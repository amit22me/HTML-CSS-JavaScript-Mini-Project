<h3>#Inspiration</h3>
<p>I built this project because i was interested in JavaScript part of web designing, mostly the animation.Since I am a beginner I wanted to design something simple yet useful that can be used by any person.I started developing simple animations and during that period I got the idea of building a clock.</p>
<h3>#Tools</h3>
<p>This project was built using HTML,CSS & JavaScript.I used JS mostly for creating the animation of hour, minute and second hands.I used CSS for designing light mode and dark mode.The use of HTML on this project was very low.</p>
